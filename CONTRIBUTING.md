# Contributing
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Style
Most important: Look around. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming things in code, naming things in documentation.

Our basic code formatting rules are encoded in `.eslintrc` and are enforced by the linter. When encoding functionality described in the JavaScript spec (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/), ensure that you copy+paste the relevant section number and individual steps.
